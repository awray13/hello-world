# hello-world
Just another repository
My name is Ashton Wray.
I'm a recent veteran, wife, and mother of 4 lovely children.
I'm not real big on talking about myself. I hope to do the work and let it speak for me.
I'm by no means new to the tech world, but I am a bit of a newbie when it comes to web dev and programming,
(hopefully not for long)!
My ultimate goal is to learn as much as I can and gain enployment while I'm at it!!!
